# -JM10c -R80/110/0/35 has to be same parameters as the basemap command
# -W(number)p indicates pen width
#
# -L87/3+c3+w500k+u
# -L indicates adding a scale
# 87/3 is the lat/long on the map where the bar is plotted
# c3 is the lattitude the distance is calculated at (in this case, 3 N)
# w500k determines length of scale bar (500 of unit, k for kilometers)
# u indicates that unuts are plotted on scale bar
#
# -G(R/G/B) is for plotting ground color with pscoast
# -S(R/G/B) is for water
# -N1/0.25p is draw political boundaries (N1 is for countries) and the pen width
# -Df indicates full resolution for drawing
# Other options for -D: h-high, i-intermediate (default), l-low, c-crude
# -K indicates that more will be added
